    // then (very) bad things will happen if a CPU interrupt occurs, as the
    // start of memory on an x86 system is the location of the real mode IVT
    // (Interrupt Vector Table). If an interrupt occurs, it will attempt to use
    // the function addresses stored in the table, and if those addresses are
    // invalid, junk code will execute.

    // Next we set two segment registers, the data segment register and the
    // extra segment register, to 0x0000 and 0xFFFF, respectively. We do this

    // byte of memory after 1MiB of total memory.
